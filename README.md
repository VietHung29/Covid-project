# COVID-19 ANALYSIS, VISUALIZATION AND PREDICTION

This project aims to analyze the factors affecting the COVID-19 mortality rate across different countries, visualize the data trends, and predict the future incidence of the disease. The project uses data from Our World in Data, which is a scientific online publication that provides reliable and up-to-date data on various global issues. The data set covers the period from January 1, 2020 to April 30, 2021, and includes variables such as total cases, total deaths, population, health expenditure, vaccination rate, and testing rate.

# Methods
The project consists of the following steps:

Data cleaning and preprocessing: The data set is imported, checked for missing values and outliers, and transformed into a suitable format for analysis.

Exploratory data analysis: The data set is summarized and visualized using descriptive statistics and graphs to understand the distribution and relationship of the variables.

Correlation analysis: The correlation between the COVID-19 mortality rate and the health system and vaccination rate of each country is calculated and tested using Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficient and p-value.

Machine learning model: A machine learning model is built to predict the number of people infected with COVID-19 in the future based on the current data. The model is trained and tested using a split of 80% and 20% of the data, respectively. The model performance is evaluated using metrics such as mean squared error and R-squared.

Data visualization: The results of the analysis and the model are presented using Power BI, a business analytics tool that allows creating interactive and appealing dashboards and reports.
